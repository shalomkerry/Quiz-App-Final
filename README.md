# Capstone Project

## Overview
This is my capstone project where I applied the knowledge gained during the 4-month frontend lessons with ALX. The project demonstrates my skills in building interactive and dynamic web applications using modern frontend technologies.

## Features
- Fetches trivia questions using the [Trivia API](https://the-trivia-api.com/v2/questions/).
- A user-friendly interface for displaying and interacting with trivia questions.
- Dynamic dropdowns and state management using React libraries.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: For building the UI components and managing application state.
- **HTML & CSS**: For structuring and styling the application.

## Libraries Utilized
Some of the libraries that were particularly helpful during the project:
- **react-select**: For creating customizable dropdowns.
- **SWR**: For data fetching, caching, and revalidation.

## Key Learnings
- The importance of consistent and strategic googling while coding. It was a valuable lesson to learn how to effectively search for solutions and understand documentation.
- How to integrate third-party APIs into a frontend application.
- Leveraging React libraries to streamline development and improve the user experience.
